title: 'Global-scale GDPR Compliant Data Sharing System'
abstract: 'Personal data protection associated with regulatory compliance is often siloed as legal documentation that is not suitable for GDPR compliant system implementation. In a real global-scale industrial environment, applying novel personal data protection technologies directly to industrial sites has the potential risk to cause unintended disclosure of personal information, which results in a huge monetary penalty. In this paper, the Global-scale GDPR Compliant Data Sharing (GDS) system is introduced which enables efficient data retrieval and data sharing process while protecting personal information.'
